# nuxt3-vuetify-template

This is a template for Nuxt3 and Vuetify applications.

- Added Volar, prettier-vscode, vscode-eslint as recommended VSCode extensions.
- ESlint and prettier are linked with VSCode.
- launch.json for debug using Chrome, Edge, Firefox.
  - Requires installation of extensions for each browser.
  - Chrome or Edge is recommended for ubuntu 22.04.
    - Firefox (snap version) cannot start browser with debug. The deb package version has no problem starting, but it seems that break points cannot be set correctly.

**If you do not understand the contents, I strongly recommend that you first investigate and try to build from scratch by yourself (it will also be a study).**
